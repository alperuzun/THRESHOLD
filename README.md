# THRESHOLD

THRESHOLD is a novel gene saturation analysis GUI. THRESHOLD analyzes transcriptomic data across large samples of patients to understand the cohesion of the most upregulated/downregulated genes in a given disease. This lends researchers knowledge to inform network topology analyses or to assess the relative amount of genes influencing a given disease. THRESHOLD offers several features to aid in analysis including user-inputted saturation type, restriction factors, and rank type. The tool outputs an interactive graph of saturation permitting the calculation of specific saturation thresholds and most saturated genes.
